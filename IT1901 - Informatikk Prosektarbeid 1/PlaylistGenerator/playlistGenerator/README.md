# **Playlist Generator:**
This app is a tool for creating playlists, based on ratings and moods selected for songs added into the site. Users of the app collectively enter songs which they give a rating between 0-10 and some moods which they assiciate the song with. If the song is already in the system, a new rating will be calculated as the mean of all the ratings entered. Moods will be added ontop of already entered moods. 
When a user wants to create a playlist, they can give it a name and then choose a minimum or maximum rating for the song to have. The user can also select one or more moods which they want the songs in the playlist to have. A user can update an old playlist to add/remove songs according to the specifications based on the current list of songs in the system. 
The user can find playlists created earlier and other users' playlist by searching. An overview of 
the playlist specification and the songs it contains is the displayed. 

The app will have three tabs, one for each of what we have defined as core functionality. Adding a song, creating a playlist and looking at playlists. When one first opens the app, the add song-tab is open, and you can navigate between tabs on top of the page. We have included a mock up sketch of what we want the app to look like.

# **User stories:**
As a tool to establish the functionality needed in the app, we have imagined some user stories. They will be presented beneath: 

User Story 1: As a user I want to be able to add a song, with its info, moods and rating, to a song database to share with all other users.
